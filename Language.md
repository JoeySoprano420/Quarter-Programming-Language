# 🚀 Quarter Programming Language (v3.0)

> *Readable like English. Powerful like Assembly. Beautiful like poetry. Now faster than C++.*

Quarter is a next-generation, high-readability programming language built for **speed**, **clarity**, and **future-proof power**. With capsule-aware AOT compilation, inline NASM, DG arithmetic, and native threading pipelines, it’s engineered to outperform C++ in real-world scenarios—without sacrificing elegance.

---

## 🌟 Overview
**Quarter** is a semantically rich, ultra-fluent programming language based on:
- ✅ Itemized Transformative Objectives (ITO)
- ✅ Functional Directives
- ✅ Sequential Iterative Imperatives
- ✅ Lateral Procedural Design
- ✅ Longitudinal Full Stack Scoping

---

## ✨ Highlights
- 🔤 English-like readable syntax
- 🧠 Derivative-based logic (`derive`)
- 🧮 Built-in dodecagram base-12 math (`dg`)
- 💥 Inline NASM injection
- ⚡ Capsule format bundling NASM + source
- 🧵 Native threading and reactive `subnet` pipelines
- 📈 Inline learning observers and self-tuning runtime
- 🔁 Toggle JIT/AOT execution

## 🛠 Compiler Architecture

### 🎯 Capsule-Aware AOT Compiler
- **Frontend**: `.quarter` → AST
- **IR Layer**: Custom IR → LLVM IR
- **Backend**: LLVM → NASM → `.qtrcapsule`
- **Capsule Format**: Compressed NASM + source + DG metadata

### 🧪 LLVM + NASM Hybrid
- LLVM: high-level optimization
- NASM: low-level precision
- JIT toggle based on runtime context

---

## 🧠 QuarterOps Runtime Engine
- Built in **Rust** or **Zig**
- Core Features:
  - SIMD-accelerated DG arithmetic
  - Capsule memory arenas
  - Lock-free thread orchestration

### Capsule Execution
- `.qtrcapsule` includes:
  - Hot-swapping support
  - `pipe` / `subnet` chaining
  - Embedded learning observers

---

## 🧮 DG Arithmetic Acceleration
- Base-12 (DG) digits: `0–9`, `X`=10, `Y`=11
- AVX2/AVX-512 optimization
- Functions:
  - `to_dg(n)`
  - `from_dg(s)`
  - `dg_add(a, b)`
  - `dg_mul(a, b)`

---

## 🧵 Concurrency & Subnet Pipelining
- `thread`: Native threading or fibers
- `pipe`: Memory-mapped stream channel
- `subnet`: Reactive dataflow graph engine

---

## 🧬 Learning Observers
- Inline profiling system in capsules
- Adjusts:
  - Thread pools
  - Memory layout
  - Loop unrolling
- Includes:
  - Capsule Profiler
  - Visual heatmaps
  - Optimization export

---

## 🛠️ Developer Experience

### 🖥 Quarter IDE
- NASM visualizer
- Capsule debugger
- DG arithmetic explorer

### 🌐 Capsule Playground
- Web REPL
- Upload `.qtrcapsule` files
- Real-time benchmarking
