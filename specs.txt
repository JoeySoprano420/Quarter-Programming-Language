# 🚀 Quarter Programming Language (v3.0)

> *Readable like English. Powerful like Assembly. Beautiful like poetry. Now faster than C++.*

Quarter is a next-generation, high-readability programming language built for **speed**, **clarity**, and **future-proof power**. With capsule-aware AOT compilation, inline NASM, DG arithmetic, and native threading pipelines, it’s engineered to outperform C++ in real-world scenarios—without sacrificing elegance.

---

## 🌟 Overview
**Quarter** is a high-readability, semantically rich, ultra-fluent programming language built on:
- ✅ Itemized Transformative Objectives (ITO)
- ✅ Functional Directives
- ✅ Sequential Iterative Imperatives
- ✅ Lateral Procedural Design
- ✅ Longitudinal Full Stack Scoping

It features derivative logic, dodecagram (DG) numeric base, inline NASM, capsule compilation, and capsule-aware AOT execution.

---

## ✨ Highlights
- 🔤 English-like readable syntax
- 🧠 Derivative-based logic (`derive`)
- 🧮 Built-in dodecagram base-12 math (`dg`)
- 💥 Inline NASM injection
- ⚡ Capsule format bundling NASM + source
- 🧵 Native threading and reactive `subnet` pipelines
- 📈 Inline learning observers and self-tuning runtime
- 🔁 Toggle JIT/AOT execution

## ⚡ Quarter vs C++: Domination Blueprint
| Metric | C++ Strength | Quarter v3.0 Goal |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 🧠 Compile-time | Fast with `clang`, `gcc` | Faster with capsule caching |
| 🚀 Runtime Speed | Near-optimal with hand-tuned code | Equal or better via NASM + LLVM fusion |
| 🧩 Memory Efficiency | Manual control | Capsule-aware memory pools |
| 🧵 Concurrency | Threads, async, atomics | Native `thread`, `pipe`, `subnet` |
| 🛠️ Tooling | Mature ecosystem | Capsule IDE + visual debugger |
| 🧬 Extensibility | Templates, macros | Inline learning observers, DG logic |

## 🛠 Compiler Architecture

### 🎯 Capsule-Aware AOT Compiler
- **Frontend**: `.quarter` → AST
- **IR Layer**: Custom IR → LLVM IR
- **Backend**: LLVM → NASM → `.qtrcapsule`
- **Capsule Format**: Compressed NASM + source + DG metadata

### 🧪 LLVM + NASM Hybrid
- LLVM for high-level optimization
- Direct NASM for low-level control
- Loader toggles JIT/AOT intelligently

---

## 🧠 QuarterOps Runtime Engine
- Written in Rust or Zig
- Features:
  - SIMD-accelerated DG arithmetic
  - Capsule memory arenas
  - Lock-free thread orchestration

### Capsule Execution
- Loads `.qtrcapsule`
- Supports:
  - Hot-swapping capsules
  - Capsule chaining via `pipe`, `subnet`
  - Inline learning observers

---

## 🧮 DG Arithmetic Acceleration
- AVX2/AVX-512 optimized `dg_add`, `dg_mul`
- Intrinsics for `to_dg`, `from_dg`
- Loop unrolling and constant folding for DGs

---

## 🧵 Concurrency & Subnet Pipelining
- `thread` compiles to OS threads or fibers
- `pipe` → memory-mapped async streams
- `subnet` defines dataflow graphs

---

## 🧬 Learning Observers
- Capsules embed real-time metrics
- Runtime dynamically tunes:
  - Thread pools
  - Memory layout
  - Unroll factors

### Capsule Profiler
- Visual heatmaps
- Export optimized variants

---

## 🛠️ Developer Experience
### Quarter IDE
- Capsule debugger
- DG calculator
- NASM visualizer

### Capsule Playground
- Web-based REPL
- Upload capsules for testing and benchmarking
