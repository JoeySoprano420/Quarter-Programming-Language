# Quarter Programming Language 

> “Readable like English. Powerful like Assembly. Beautiful like poetry.” “Built to read like vision, execute like code, and endure like art.”

---

## 🌟 Overview
**Quarter** is a high-readability, semantically rich, ultra-fluent programming language built on:
- ✅ Itemized Transformative Objectives (ITO)
- ✅ Functional Directives
- ✅ Sequential Iterative Imperatives
- ✅ Lateral Procedural Design
- ✅ Longitudinal Full Stack Scoping

It features derivative logic, dodecagram (DG) numeric base, inline NASM, and capsule compilation.

## 🧠 Expressions
### 🔢 Arithmetic & Logic
```quarter
val result as int: 10 + 5 * 2
```

### 🔍 Comparison
```quarter
when x > 100:
  say "Big!"
```

### 💬 String Interpolation
```quarter
val name as string: "Joey"
say "Hi, {name}"
```

---

## 🧩 Derivatives
```quarter
val base as int: 10
derive total from base by 5  # total = base + 5
```

---

## 🧮 Dodecagrams (DGs)
### 📌 DG Notation
```quarter
val d as dg: 9A1
say from_dg(d)        # → decimal
say to_dg(1234)       # → base-12
```

### ➕ DG Math
```quarter
say dg_add(100, 200)  # → base-12 sum
say dg_mul(12, 12)    # → base-12 product
```

> DG digits: 0–9, X (=10), Y (=11)
